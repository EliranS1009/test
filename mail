I have set up an App Registration with the ID [Insert App ID Here] and granted it the offline_access permission under Delegated Permissions. I integrated it into a React-based website that authenticates users via Azure AD, allowing me to receive both refresh and access tokens upon login.
To maintain session continuity, I utilize the acquireTokenSilent function every minute to request new access and refresh tokens without requiring user interaction.
For testing purposes, I used a user account with the ID [Insert User ID Here], applying Conditional Access to limit the session duration to one hour. My goal was to verify that the offline_access permission would allow token refresh beyond the session expiration without requiring the user to log in again.
However, after one hour, the session is terminated, and I am unable to renew the access token, even though the offline_access permission was granted.
I would greatly appreciate your guidance on this issue. Is there any additional configuration required to ensure that the refresh token continues working beyond the session expiration?
Thank you for your assistance.
Best regards,
